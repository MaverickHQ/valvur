"""Adapter for valvur's own Checks.

Because Checks run in the container and emit JSON (ADR-0013), they fit the *existing*
adapter contract exactly: `run` invokes the container, `parse` reads the JSON. The
orchestrator needed no change — Checks inherit failure isolation, Profile selection,
concurrency and Provenance from the fleet.

`kind` is what separates them, and it is not cosmetic: we credit **Scanners** by name
and licence (P4), and must never imply that detection we perform ourselves came from
a third-party tool, nor the reverse.
